### Work around method chaining problem

For example:

```go
  something := thing.DoSomething()
  something = something.DoAnotherThing()
  something = something.DoSomethingElse()
```

Would be nice to enable method chaining here. If we try that now, we get:

`"cannot call pointer method on thing.DoSomething()"`
