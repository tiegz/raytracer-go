- AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box):

- CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry):

- Normal:

- Intersection:

- UV mapping:

- Bounding Boxes: an optimzation that provides a min/max tuple to hint to us if we should test any given shape, based on the shapes shapes and dimensions. If not, we can save the computation and time.

- BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy): a tree of Bounding Boxes that can be traversed to determine if an intersection should be tested for any given shape in the tree.
